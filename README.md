This project is designed as a continuous monitoring system rather than a one-off analysis.
SQL is used to enforce data integrity and maintain historical state, while Python handles anomaly detection and decision logic.
Visualization focuses on surfacing actionable, location-aware signals rather than exploratory analysis.

由于只有一个dataset而且没有很多可以做a/b testing 对比的数据，不能做太多事情。如果有更多的数据比如这几个renovated road (for wider bike lane)看起效程度，会对政策有个更准确的回报评估，也能起到支持政策总结的效果。
